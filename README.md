# static-comp-challenge

By: Cameron Mackintosh (https://github.com/cbmackintosh)

The purpose of this project was to gain practice with using HTML and CSS to recreate a provided static comp as closely as possible. No JavaScript functionality was expected, however the webpage responsiveness across multiple screen-sizes was a requirement. Students were given some creative license over the design of the webpage, however the objective was to build something that respected the integrity of the original design.

See below for a comparison between the comp sheet (above) and my recreation (below):
